1. Website Setup (Custom, No WordPress)

Use Flask (Python) or Node.js (JavaScript) on Replit to run your backend.

Use HTML + CSS + JS (frontend) for your website design.

Create pages/sections like:

Home (Today’s Deals)

Tech

Furniture

Fashion

Etc.

👉 Directory example:

/static        → CSS, images, JS
/templates     → HTML files
app.py         → Flask backend (or index.js for Node)

🔹 2. AI Blog Generation

When you paste an affiliate link + product name, your backend calls an AI API (ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) to generate content.

The AI generates:

Product description

Review post

Pros/Cons

SEO title + meta description

Blog body with your affiliate link inserted

👉 Example (Flask backend):

from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import openai  # or Gemini/Claude API

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/add", methods=["POST"])
def add_product():
    product_name = request.form["name"]
    affiliate_link = request.form["link"]
    
    prompt = f"Write a detailed product review for {product_name}. Include overview, features, pros & cons, and add CTA with this affiliate link: {affiliate_link}."
    
    blog_post = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-4o-mini",
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": prompt}]
    )
    
    content = blog_post["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
    return render_template("blog.html", content=content)

🔹 3. Automation Flow

You open an admin panel (custom page on your site).

Paste: Product Name + Affiliate Link.

AI generates a blog post automatically.

The blog is saved in your database (SQLite, Firebase, or even JSON file).

Frontend auto-shows it under the right section (Tech, Furniture, Deals).

🔹 4. Example Workflow

Add: Samsung 55-inch 4K Smart TV + Amazon affiliate link.

Select Section: Tech → Electronics → TVs.

AI generates blog with:

Title: “Samsung 55-inch 4K Smart TV Review (2025) – Is It Worth It?”

Sections: Overview, Features, Pros & Cons, Alternatives, Verdict.

CTA Button: Check Price on Amazon (with your link).

🔹 5. Bonus Automation

Amazon/Flipkart API → Auto-fetch product price, images, rating.

Scheduler (Cron job on Replit) → Auto-post “Today’s Deals” daily with AI text.

Zapier/Make.com → Auto-publish new blogs to Twitter/Instagram.

✅ End result → You’ll have your own AI-powered affiliate site hosted on Replit, where you just paste a link and AI handles the blogging.
